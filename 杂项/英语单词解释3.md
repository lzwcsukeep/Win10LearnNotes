# What is Export Compliance?

Governments and international bodies maintain regulations and rules governing all export activities within their jurisdictions. Export compliance, therefore, refers to the act of complying with these regulations. It is the legal obligation of organizations to comply with all export regulations and rules that are relevant and applicable to the jurisdictions where they conduct business.
