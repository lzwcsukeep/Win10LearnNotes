### name resolution

> **Converting a name into the address** required by a machine or network. For example, in a TCP/IP network (the worldwide standard), common examples of name resolution are converting a human-readable name assigned to a computer to its IP address in the network or converting a domain name to its IP address on the Internet. Looking up a phone number by turning the pages in a telephone book is a human version of name resolution. See [address resolution](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/address-resolution), [resolve](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/resolve), [naming service](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/naming-service), [WINS](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/wins) and [DNS](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/dns).

### resolve

> **To look up an address.** For example, "to resolve a name" means to look up the corresponding address for that name (see [name resolution](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/name-resolution)). The phrase "external references in the program were resolved" means that tables were searched, and all references to routines outside of the program were given valid addresses. See [address resolution](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/address-resolution), [resolver](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/resolver) and [resolution](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/resolution).

### address resolution

> Acquiring a physical address. When a computer executes instructions, it requires a physical memory, storage or network node address to reference the actual hardware. For ease of recognition, names are often initially used to identify such objects, but have to be substituted with the "real" machine addresses in order to perform the actual operation. Machine addresses are derived using table lookups and algorithms. The terms "address resolution" and "name resolution" are synonymous.
> 
> **Name to IP to Ethernet**
> In a TCP/IP network, there are two address resolutions. The first is the conversion from a domain and hostname into an IP address (see [DNS](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/dns)). The second is from the IP address to the Ethernet address (see [ARP](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/arp)). See [ARP](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/arp), [resolve](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/resolve), [name resolution](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/name-resolution) and [DNS](https://www.pcmag.com/encyclopedia/term/dns).

### symbolic reference in Java

> A symbolic reference is a **character string** that gives the name and possibly other information about the referenced item -- **enough information to uniquely identify a class, field, or method. **Thus, symbolic references to other classes give the **full name of the class.** Symbolic references to the fields of other classes give the **class name, field name, and field descriptor.** Symbolic references to the methods of other classes give the **class name, method name, and method descriptor.**
> 
> When a class file is loaded, it contains symbolic references to other classes and their fields and methods. Dynamic linking is the process of resolving symbolic references into direct references. As the JVM executes bytecodes and encounters an opcode that, for the first time, uses a symbolic reference to another class, the virtual machine must resolve the symbolic reference. The virtual machine performs two basic tasks during resolution:
> \- It finds the class being referenced (loading it if necessary).
> \- It replaces the symbolic reference with a direct reference, such as a pointer or offset, to the class, field, or method.
> The virtual machine remembers the direct reference so that if it encounters the same reference again later, it can immediately use the direct reference without needing to spend time resolving the symbolic reference again.
> 
> 符号引用以一组符号来描述所引用的目标，符号可以是任何形式的字面量，只要使用时能够无歧义的定位到目标即可。在Java中，一个java类将会编译成一个class文件。在编译时，java类并不知道所引用的类的实际地址，因此只能使用符号引用来代替。符号引用的字面量形式明确定义在Java虚拟机规范的Class文件格式中。

### Direct reference in Java

> 直接引用：直接指向目标的指针，相对偏移量或者句柄
> 
> 直接引用可以是
> 
> （1）直接指向目标的指针（比如，指向“类型”【Class对象】、类变量、类方法的直接引用可能是指向方法区的指针）
> 
> （2）相对偏移量（比如，指向实例变量、实例方法的直接引用都是偏移量）
> 
> （3）一个能间接定位到目标的句柄
> 
> 直接引用是和虚拟机的布局相关的，同一个符号引用在不同的虚拟机实例上翻译出来的直接引用一般不会相同。**如果有了直接引用，那引用的目标必定已经被加载入内存中了。**

### Metadata

> Metadata is data about data. You can think metadata is a short explanation or summary of what the data is .In other words, it's information that's used to describe the data that's contained in something like a web page, document, or file. 
> 
> 中文简述：描述数据的数据。也就是说数据的简介。元数据用来快速的了解这个数据，而不是保存这个数据本身。

### What is the difference between build and compile?

> **Compiling** is the act of turning source code into object code.
> 
> **Linking** is the act of combining object code with libraries into a raw executable.
> 
> **Building** is the sequence composed of compiling and linking, with possibly other tasks such as installer creation.
> 
> They often are used to mean the same thing. However, "build" may also mean the full process of compiling and linking a whole application (in the case of e.g. C and C++), or even more, including, among others
> 
> - packaging
> - automatic (unit and/or integration) testing
> - installer generation
> - installation/deployment
> - documentation/site generation
> - report generation (e.g. test results, coverage).
> 
> There are systems like [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/), which generalize this with the concept of *lifecycle*, which consists of several stages, producing different artifacts, possibly using results and artifacts from previous stages.

### Dynamic linking in Java

> Dynamic linking is the process of resolving symbolic references into direct references.
> 
> 中文简述：Java的动态链接就是将符号引用转化成直接引用的过程。

### stack frames(or frames) in java

> The Java stack is composed of stack frames (or frames).**A stack frame contains the state of one Java method invocation.** When a thread invokes a method, the Java Virtual Machine pushes a new frame onto that threadís Java stack. When the method completes, the virtual machine pops and discards the frame for that method.
> 
> Each frame has its own array of local variables (§2.6.1), its own operand stack (§2.6.2), and a reference to the run-time constant pool (§2.5.5) of the class of the current method.
> 
> 也就是说栈帧是用来帮助线程中方法的调用的，一个方法对应一个栈帧
> 
> 每个栈帧都有以下组成部分（据jvms11）：
> 
> 1. 局部变量表
> 2. 操作数栈
> 3. 指向常量池中当前栈帧对应方法所属的类的索引
> 4. 与具体实现相关的其他信息

## Core Concepts for Package Management in Linux

下面三个概念是linux下包管理工具涉及的核心概念

### Packages

> 什么是packages
> 
> Most software applications designed for Linux or Unix systems are distributed as *packages*, which are archives that contain the pre-compiled binary software files, installation scripts, configuration files, dependency requirements, and other details about the software. These packages are typically specific to a particular distribution and formatted in that distribution’s preferred package format, such as `.deb` for Debian/Ubuntu and `.rpm` for CentOS/RHEL.
> 
> While it’s relatively simple for a user to install a package file, there are other complexities to consider. These complexities include obtaining (downloading) the package, ensuring packages are upgraded with security and bug fixes, and maintaining all the dependencies for the software.

### Repositories

> 什么是仓库
> 
> While a user can obtain package files through any method of file transfer, it is typical to use *software repositories* (also called *repos*) to obtain packages. Repositories are simply the location where the packages are stored, commonly accessible via the internet. A repository can contain a single package or thousands of packages. Most Linux distributions have their own unique repositories, sometimes separating out their cores packages into one while additional features are in others.

### Dependencies

> 什么是包的依赖
> 
> Its very common in almost any operating system for software to require other software to run. In Linux, each package contains metadata detailing the additional packages that are required. These additional packages are called *dependencies*. A single package can sometimes have hundreds of dependencies. When installing, upgrading, or removing packages, these dependencies may also need to installed, upgraded, and optionally removed.
