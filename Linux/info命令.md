### What is an INFO file?

An INFO file is a formatted information document created by Texinfo, a GNU Project help document generation tool. It stores documentation in a **book format** with chapters, sections, and subsections and can contain up to four layers of depth.

### More Information

INFO documents are used for storing software help manuals and technical books. They can be viewed with an Info viewer, such as Texinfo's Info reader or GNU Emacs.

### What is Texinfo?

*Texinfo* is a documentation system that uses a single source file to produce both online information and printed output. This means that instead of writing several different documents, one for each output format, you need only write one document.

Using Texinfo, you can create a printed document (via the TeX typesetting system) in PDF format, including chapters, sections, cross-references, and indices. From the same Texinfo source file, you can create HTML output suitable for use with a web browser, you can create an Info file for use in GNU Emacs or other Info-reading programs, and also create DocBook, EPUB 3, or LaTeX files.

Texinfo is a GNU project.
