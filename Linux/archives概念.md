An archive is a single file holding a collection of other files in a structure that makes it
       possible to retrieve the original individual files (called members of the archive).

The original files' contents, mode (permissions), timestamp, owner, and group are preserved in the archive, and can be restored on extraction.



The command `ar` is considered a binary utility because archives of this sort are most often used as `libraries` holding commonly needed subroutines.
