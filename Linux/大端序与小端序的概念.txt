A big-endian system stores the **most significant byte** of a word at the smallest memory address and the least significant byte at the largest.













A little-endian system, in contrast, stores the least-significant byte at the smallest address.

Of the two, big-endian is thus closer to the way the digits of numbers are written left-to-right in English, comparing digits to bytes.
