### Concept

ALL operating system provides services for programs they run. Typical services include executing a new program, opening a file,reading a file,

allocating a region of memory,getting the current time of a day and so on.

In a strict sense,an operating system can be defined as the software that controls the hardware resources of the computer and provides an environment under which programs can run.Generally,we call this software the kernel,since it is relatively small and resides at the core of the environment.

In a broad sense, an operating system consists of the kernel and all the other
software that makes a computer useful and gives the computer its personality. This
other software includes system utilities, applications, shells, libraries of common
functions, and so on.

所有的操作系统都为运行在其上的程序提供各种服务，如执行一个新的程序，打开文件，读取文件，分配内存。

严格意义上，操作系统的定义是控制计算机的硬件资源并提供程序可以运行的环境的软件(内核)。

通俗意义上，一个操作系统由内核和所有其他让计算机变得有用和有自身特点的软件组成。这些软件包括系统功能，应用程序，shells，常见函数的库等。



### what is clock time,user cpu time and system cpu time？

Clock time, user CPU time, and system CPU time are all concepts related to measuring the execution time of a program or process in a computer system:

1. **Clock Time:** Clock time, also known as wall-clock time or real time, refers to the actual elapsed time from the start of a process to its completion. It's the time that would be measured by a clock on the wall. It includes all time, regardless of whether the CPU is actively executing the process or if it's waiting for input/output operations (I/O), or any other reason. Clock time is influenced by factors such as the system load, I/O operations, and concurrent processes running on the system.

2. **User CPU Time:** User CPU time represents the amount of time that the CPU spends executing code within the user space of a process. It includes the time spent executing instructions from the user program itself, excluding time spent on system calls and kernel operations. User CPU time is typically indicative of the computational work done directly by the program.

3. **System CPU Time:** System CPU time, on the other hand, represents the amount of time that the CPU spends executing system calls and kernel operations on behalf of the process. These operations include tasks such as I/O operations, memory management, and other system-level operations that are necessary for the program's execution but are not part of the user program itself. System CPU time is often indicative of the overhead associated with managing the process by the operating system.

In summary, clock time measures the overall elapsed time, user CPU time measures the time spent executing user program code, and system CPU time measures the time spent executing system-level operations on behalf of the process. These metrics are useful for understanding the performance characteristics of a program and diagnosing potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
