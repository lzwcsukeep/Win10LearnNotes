Q：What is the difference between x86_64 and AMD64?
A:They are the same.

AMD was the first to create 64-bit extensions to the x86 instruction set. 
(Intel at the moment decided to go a different path, developing IA64 with HP, practically co-opting HP’s PA-RISC CPUs to become Itanium CPUs).

The Open Source community appreciates AMD’s breakthrough and 
decided to give the code name of “amd64” to the extensions (to prevent confusion with Intel’s 64-bit instruction set “ia64”).

Intel naturally doesn’t like this situation and ‘gently’ ‘suggested’ an alternative, more vendor-neutral moniker of “x86_64”. 
Some Open Source community took the bait and changed the moniker. Others don’t see the need to change and keep using the “amd64” moniker.

But for all practical purposes with no exceptions, the two monikers — “x86_64” and “amd64” — are exactly the same.
