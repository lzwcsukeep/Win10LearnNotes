In all Unix and Unix-like systems, as well as on Windows, each process has its own separate set of environment variables. 



By default, when a process is created, it inherits a duplicate run-time environment of its parent process, except for explicit changes made by the parent when it creates the child.



At the API level, these changes must be done between running `fork` and `exec`. 

Alternatively, from command shells such as bash, a user can change environment variables for a particular command invocation by indirectly invoking it via `env` or using the `ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE=VALUE <command> `notation. A running program can access the values of environment variables for configuration purposes.
