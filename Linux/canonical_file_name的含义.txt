canonical file name 翻译成中文比较合适的是叫规范文件名或标准文件名。
是什么含义呢？为什么要有这个canonical file name？
有这个名词canonical的主要意义是为了比较两个路径是否是同一个路径。
在linux 上 ../../here/bar/x 和 ./test/../../bar/x 可能指向的是同一个位置，但是单纯比较路径文本你是看不出来的，
因此转化成一个规范化路径，可能两者都变成了../bar/x。这时候从路径文本上你就可以看出来两个路径是否一样了。
这就是canonical file name的意义。

from stackoverflow:
> The whole point of making anything "canonical" is so that you can compare two things. For example, both ../../here/bar/x and ./test/../../bar/x may refer to the same location, but you can't do a textual comparison on the two paths. However, if you turn them into their canonical representation, they both become ../bar/x, and we see that they actually refer to the same thing.

In short, it is often the case that you have many ways of referring to one thing, and in that case you may be able to define a canonical representation which is unique and which allows you to get a handle on col­lections of such things.
