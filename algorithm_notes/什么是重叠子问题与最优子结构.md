英文overlapping subproblems

> A problem is said to have overlapping subproblems if the problem can be broken down into subproblems which are reused several times **OR** a recursive algorithm for the problem solves the same subproblem over and over rather than always generating new subproblems.

> Both definitions (and lots of others on the internet) seem to boil down to a problem having overlapping subproblems if finding its solution involves solving the same subproblems multiple times. In other words, there are many small sub-problems which are computed many times during finding the solution to the original problem. A classic example is the Fibonacci algorithm that lots of examples use to make people understand this property.

英文Optimal substructure

> In [computer science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science "Computer science"), a problem is said to have **optimal substructure** if an optimal solution can be constructed from optimal solutions of its subproblems. This property is used to determine the usefulness of greedy algorithms for a problem

在计算机科学中，如果可以根据**子问题**的最优解构造最优解，则称该问题具有最优子结构。

即一个问题的最优解可以从子问题的最优解得到，则该问题具有最优子结构。
